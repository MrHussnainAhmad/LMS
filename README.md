# Nisaab360

A full-stack, multi-tenant school and learning-management application built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL/Drizzle and Valkey. It includes institution, staff, student, parent and platform portals, public institution websites and admissions.

Contributors and coding agents should read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

Use [.env.example](.env.example) for configuration names and [deployment/README.md](deployment/README.md) for release instructions. `npm run verify:local` runs the maintained checks. `npm run build` creates a production build; `npm start` starts local dependencies, runs migrations and launches the application and email worker. Never copy private environment values or access tokens into documentation.

Operational references:

- [Payment gateway setup](docs/payment-gateway-setup.md)
- [Institution backups](docs/institution-backups.md)
- [Capacity operations](docs/operational-capacity.md)
- [Release and tenant-host setup](deployment/README.md)

Git excludes local seed/reset/repair tools, verifiers that use live service credentials, performance experiments, dated reports, captured diagnostics, credentials and generated artifacts. Build/runtime/release tools and maintained isolated checks are explicitly allowed in Git. Docker admits only six required build/runtime script inputs; tests and local/release/recovery tools stay outside production images. Local load tools under `k6/` and other excluded scripts remain usable in this workspace but are not included in a Git checkout.
